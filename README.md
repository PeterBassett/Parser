Parser experimentation.

Simple Expression Parsing Complete. Only literals really supported.
Statement Parser is more full featured. Various control flow statements implemented, functions, lambdas and recursion supported.

Still to add input values to the execution engine.
Type checking will be optional and supported in a separate AST node visitor.

More to come in future.
